In this series I will go through the books of "Matrix Analysis" and "Matrix Computations" to dive into the strange properties of matrices. My experience with them comes from a graduate level course I took in my master's program. I passed the course, although not so easily I have to admit, but did not really have time to really understand why matrices have such weird properties. Like why would a container of numbers have any properties at all.
This "weirdness" is totally subjective and in this series I would like to study them with a bit more time and try to write down my intuitions for reference in the future for me.

My initial plan is along the line of: 
- Read basic chapters from the reference books
- Put down notes where monsieur matrix appears to acknowledge an idea
- Do some exercises

Of course the important is to make the abstract ideas useful on the computer for real problems 
I will also put importance on implementation because it is easier to "understand" on paper but more painful 
to implement and that is where learning happens most of the time for me.
