In this series I will go through the books of "Matrix Analysis" and "Matrix Computations" to dive into the mystical land of matrices. My experience with them comes from a graduate level course I took in my master's program. I passed the course, although not so easily I have to admit, but did not really have time to really understand why matrices have such weird properties. This "weirdness" is totally subjective and in this series I would like to study them with a bit more time and try to write down my intuitions for reference in the future for me.

My initial plan is along the line of: 
- Read basic chapters from the reference books
- Put down notes where monsieur matrix appears to acknowledge an idea
- Do some exercises
