    <p>The fundamental theorem of algebra states that any polynomial $p$ with complex coefficients and of degree at least $1$ has at least one zero in $\mathbb{C}$ (Version 1). 
This is equivalent to saying, a polynomial of degree $n \ge 1$  with complex coefficients has, counting multiplicities, exactly $n$ zeros among the complex numbers (Version 2).</p>

<h4 id="why-equivalence">Why equivalence?</h4>
<p>Version 1 $\implies$ Version 2</p>

<p>Say order $n\ge 1$ polynomial $p(x)$ has root $r$, then this means $\exists \ q(x)$ of order $n-1$ such that 
\(p(x) = q(x) (x-r)\)
Then we can descent through the orders of $q(x)$ making the same action using Version 1, therefore induction on powers of $q(x)$ gives us the $n-1$ roots. Then we can see that $p(x)$
has $n$ roots.</p>

<p>Version 1 $\impliedby$ Version 2</p>

<p>If there are $n$ roots there is at least one
So if we have some proof action for one version that is enough</p>

<h4 id="version-1-proof">Version 1 proof</h4>
<p>The fact I will take for granted is “Winding number is invariant under homotopy”. 
What winding number and homotopy mean intuitively? Using Wikipedia I have the following.</p>

<p><strong>Winding number:</strong> The winding number of a closed curve in the plane around a given point is an integer representing the total number of times that curve travels counterclockwise around the point. Imagine you are at the center and there is a running route around you and you follow your friend running, the winding number of the running route is how many times you made a full turn counterclockwise following your friend.</p>

<p><strong>Homotopy:</strong> In topology two continuous function from one spacpe to another called homotopic if one can be “continuously deformed” into the other, such a deformation being called a homotopy.</p>

<p>The proof with this fact relies on tracking how the image of a circle in the complex plane winds around the origin as you change the circles radius.</p>

<p>Assume monic polynomial of degree $n\ge 1$</p>

\[P(x) = x^n + a_{n-1} x^{n-1} + \cdots + a_{1}x + a_{0}\]

<p>and assume now $p(x)$ has no roots so $\nexists x \in \mathbb{C}$  such that $p(x) = 0$</p>

<p>If you pick $R \gg 0 \in \mathbb{R}$ and $x=Re^{i\theta}$ then</p>

\[P(Re^{i\theta}) = {R^ne^{in\theta}} + a_{n-1} {R^{n-1}e^{i(n-1)\theta}} + \cdots + a_{1}Re^{i\theta} + a_{0}\]

<p>since $R$ is huge, the first term will dominate.</p>

\[P(Re^{i\theta}) \approx {R^ne^{in\theta}}\]

<p><strong>Observation:</strong>
if you take $\theta$ from $0$ to $2\pi$ the circle $e^{i\theta}$ makes one tour around the origin. 
Important to see here, $e^{i n \theta}$ then will make $n$ tours around the origin 
since we in a way accelerate with $n$.</p>

<p>So we can say then when $R \gg 0$ the winding number of $P(R e^{i \theta})$ is $n$.</p>

<p>Now look at the other extreme when $R \approx 0$ then we have
\(P(Re^{i\theta}) \approx a_{0}\)
And since we assumed there is no root of $P$ then we know that $a_{0} \neq 0$</p>

<p>And what would be the winding number for this case, well $0$ it does not go around the origin, it is just constant.</p>

<p>Now imagine we start with a huge $R$ and smoothly reduce $R$ towards $0$, 
we saw what the winding number would be at the extremes:</p>
<ul>
  <li>$R \gg 0$ winding number $n$</li>
  <li>$R \approx 0$ winding number $0$</li>
</ul>

<p>Since we are smoothly reducing $R$ the output of $P$ (the curve it traces for our input of $R e^{i \theta}$, $\theta$ going from $0$ to $2\pi$) will also deform smoothly.</p>

<p>The winding number has to be an integer from its definition, and for this homotopic deformation we have a winding number change as $R$ changes.</p>

<p>So there must have been some origin crossings as we changed $R$ above. Which means that there must exist a $x \in \mathbb{C}$ where $P(x) = 0$
so there is at least one root for $P(x)$.</p>
